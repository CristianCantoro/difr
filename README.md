# One-minute Introduction

If you want to do a code review, and you consider all of the existing tools too bloated, too expensive or too limited, then `difr` might be perfectly suited for you.

If you pass `difr` a diff file (wherever it might come from), then `difr` will turn that diff file into an HTML file (not unlike GitHub's view of a diff) with an embedded editor for adding comments. 

Once you added all your comments, you simply save the file, or copy the entire page in your email.
